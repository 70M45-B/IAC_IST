## Introduction to Computer Architecture project
This project aims to practice the fundamentals of the Computer Architecture field, specifically assembly language programming, peripherals, and interrupts.

## How to test the project
The course Introduction to Computer Architecture uses a simulator that allows testing the operation of all systems taught within its scope.
The simulator can be executed on any platform for which there is a Java Virtual Machine (JVM), version 11, 64-bit, compatible with Windows, macOS, or Linux.
You just need to download it -> [simulador-1-5-2023.jar](https://fenix.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/downloadFile/282093452107489/simulador-1-5-2023.jar), load the 
[projeto-beyond-Mars.cir](https://github.com/tomasbernardino/IAC_IST/blob/main/proj/projeto-beyond-Mars.cir)(proj folder) on the load button (on the top) and then open the "Simulation" tab, and double click on the smooth rectangles labeled media center, and keyboard to be able to play the game.
